## The System's Components

### Terraform
* Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool that provides a consistent CLI workflow to manage hundreds of cloud services.

### SageMaker
* Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service that provides every developer and data scientist with the ability to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models quickly.

### FastAPI
* FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

### Docker
* Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.

### ML Deployment Pipeline
![My Image](./data/img/ml.png)
* The ML deployment pipeline is a CI/CD pipeline that is responsible for the deployment of the ML model to production. The pipeline is triggered by a commit to the ML model repository. The pipeline is responsible for the following steps:
    * Build the ML model Docker image.
    * Push the ML model Docker image to the ECR.
    * Deploy the ML model to the SageMaker.
